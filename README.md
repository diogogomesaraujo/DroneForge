## 🛠️ About the project

DroneForge is a comprehensive web application developed as part of the web programming curriculum in the Computer Science degree at Universidade da Beira Interior. This project is designed to facilitate drone assembly and provide users with detailed statistics and insights. Built using modern web technologies, DroneForge leverages the power of React for building the user interface, Bootstrap for responsive design, Node.js for server-side logic, and MongoDB for database management.

### Key Features

- **Drone Assembly**: Users can assemble custom drones by selecting various components and configurations.
- **User Statistics**: The application provides detailed statistics and insights on user activity and drone configurations.
- **Responsive Design**: The use of React and Bootstrap ensures that the application is accessible and user-friendly across different devices.
- **Modern Technology Stack**: The backend is powered by Node.js and MongoDB, providing a robust and scalable architecture for the application.

DroneForge is a practical implementation of web programming concepts, showcasing the integration of front-end and back-end technologies to create a seamless user experience. It is an excellent demonstration of the skills and knowledge acquired during the Computer Science program at Universidade da Beira Interior.
